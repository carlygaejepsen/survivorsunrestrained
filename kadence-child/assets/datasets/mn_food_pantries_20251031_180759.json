My husband ate one and had to spit it out because it was bad. So if would be awesome if you could check expiration dates and not hand out expired food. This is not the first time I have received expired food but the first time I had one that has been expired for almost 3 years.\r\nShannon Middendorf \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour opinion matters.
