When I went, the truck full of food showed up and many in the line would not help unload when asked.  So I jumped in the trailer and it felt good to somewhat earn my keep and a few others chipped in.  When the pantry opened, they put those that volunteered in front of the line, which made others upset but I felt we earned it.  OK, the food isn't like walking into Earth Fare but put something in my belly and I appreciate that.  The economy sucks and places like this are needed.  I respect churches that back their words when many do not.\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour opinion matters.
